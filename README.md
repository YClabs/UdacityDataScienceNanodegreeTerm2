# UdacityDataScienceNanodegreeTerm2

This repository has all the code for projects and classes which are a part of term 2 of the Udacity Data Scientist nano-degree. The files are organized in folders that are by project.

## Projects

### Project 1: Using AirBnB data to understand the homeowners' market in Seattle

#### 1. Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- IPython (display module)
- collections
- itertools (chain module)
- sklearn
- time
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (Imputer and StandardScaler modules)
- sklearn.metrics (mean_squared_error module)
- sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression module)
- sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeRegressor module)

#### 2. Project Motivation
This project is part of Term 2's first module (Introduction to Data Science) requirement, which is to use the CRISP-DM process to produce a data project. I utilised AirBnB data on Seattle homes to produce my project, which used the perspective of a Seattle home-owner. The objective is to offer a great experience for my guests while maximizing revenues. Thus, I explored ways to achieve this objective by using data to answer the following three questions:

  - a. Can we predict what drives higher ratings?
  - b. When and where are the most popular times of the year for rentals of Seattle homes?
  - c. When and where are the highest revenue-generating times of the year for Seattle home-owners?

#### 3. File Descriptions
This repo contains one file, called Udacity Term 2 Project - Seattle AirBnB.ipynb that contains the code. The data used the project is contained in the folder 'seattle'.

#### 4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

All Seattle AirBnB data was obtained from Kaggle. Other references are cited within the notebook.

### Project 2: Disaster Response Pipelines
#### 1. Installations
This project was written in Python. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

- sys
- pandas
- sqlalchemy 
- json
- plotly
- nltk
- flask
- sklearn
- collections
- pickle

#### 2. Project Motivation
This project is part of Term 2's second module (Data Engineering) requirement, which is apply data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The output is a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. 

#### 3. File Descriptions
This repo contains 3 folders (app, data and models) that contains the files to run the web app. There is a readme file containing more details on how to run the web app. 

#### 4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

Data and guidance framework for coding project was provided by Udacity.
