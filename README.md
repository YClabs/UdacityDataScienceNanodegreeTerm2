# UdacityDataScienceNanodegreeTerm2

This repository has all the code for projects and classes which are a part of term 2 of the Udacity Data Scientist nano-degree. The files are organized in folders that are by project.

Projects

Project 1: Using AirBnB data to understand the homeowners' market in Seattle

1. Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
IPython (display module)
collections
itertools (chain module)
sklearn
time
sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
sklearn.preprocessing (Imputer and StandardScaler modules)
sklearn.metrics (mean_squared_error module)
sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression module)
sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeRegressor module)

2. Project Motivation
This project is part of Term 2's first module (Introduction to Data Science) requirement, which is to use the CRISP-DM process to produce a data project. I utilised AirBnB data on Seattle homes to produce my project, which used the perspective of a Seattle home-owner. The objective is to offer a great experience for my guests while maximizing revenues. Thus, I explored ways to achieve this objective by using data to answer the following three questions:

a. Can we predict what drives higher ratings?
b. When and where are the most popular times of the year for rentals of Seattle homes?
c. When and where are the highest revenue-generating times of the year for Seattle home-owners?

3. File Descriptions
This repo contains one file, called Udacity Term 2 Project - Seattle AirBnB.ipynb that contains the code. The data used the project is contained in the folder 'seattle'.

4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

All Seattle AirBnB data was obtained from Kaggle. Other references are cited within the notebook.
